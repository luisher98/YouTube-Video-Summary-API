   "result": "In this transcript, the speaker discusses their experience using two different AI tools: ChatGPT and PentestGPT. They mention that ChatGPT has been very helpful in their daily life, assisting with various tasks and providing valuable information. However, they express some skepticism about PentestGPT, a tool designed for hacking and solving machines on platforms like Hack the Box.\n\nThe speaker explains that PentestGPT has received a lot of attention and positive reviews, but they had previously encountered issues with it and stopped using it. They decide to give it another try and see if it can successfully solve a machine they recently worked on. They follow the instructions provided by the AI, running commands and copying the results.\n\nDuring the process, the speaker realizes that PentestGPT doesn't provide all the necessary information. For example, it doesn't mention the virtual hosting applied to the machine they are trying to hack. They try to communicate this issue to the AI, but it doesn't seem to understand their request properly. The speaker continues to follow the AI's instructions but finds that it doesn't provide the guidance they were hoping for.\n\nThey express frustration with the lack of helpful information and the limitations of the AI tool. They mention that while the concept is interesting, the implementation is not effective. The speaker concludes that PentestGPT is not as useful as they had hoped and expresses disappointment in the amount of money they spent on using the tool.\n\nIn the end, they decide that it is better to learn from human experts rather than relying on AI tools like PentestGPT. They express their intention to seek guidance from experienced individuals in the field of penetration testing. The speaker also mentions their initial plan to create a YouTube video about their experience with PentestGPT but decides against it due to the tool's limitations."
