What are smart goals? A quick overview with 21 examples. What do you really want from life? We all have dreams and aspirations. Many of us long for fulfilling relationships. Some desire personal freedom. Others want fame and success. And some strive for a profitable business or career. Wherever your ambitions may lie, goal-setting can get you there. On the other hand, the wrong goal can leave you feeling frustrated and unmotivated. The trick is to create the right kind of goal and commit to it. One technique that can help is the smart goals concept. So in this video, I will provide a quick overview of smart goals. Now be sure to watch this whole video all the way to the end. Because I will also give you a free tool you can use to get started with smart goal-setting. What are smart goals? The smart goal acronym stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Here's a breakdown of each letter. S. Specific. Specific goals answer your six W questions. Who, what, where, when, which, and why. When you can identify each element, you'll know which tools and actions are required to reach a goal. Who, who is involved. What, what do you want to accomplish. Where, where will you complete the goal. When, when do you want to do it. Which, which requirements and constraints might get in your way. Why, why are you doing it. Specificity is important because when you reach these milestones, you'll know for certain you have achieved your goal. M. Measurable. Measurable goals are defined with precise times, amounts, or other units. Essentially anything that measures progress toward a goal. Creating measurable goals makes it easy to determine if you have progressed from point A to point B. Measurable goals also help you figure out when you're headed in the right direction and when you're not. Generally speaking, a measurable goal statement answers questions starting with how, such as how much, how many, and how fast. A. Attainable. Attainable goals stretch the limits of what you think is possible. While they're not impossible to complete, they're often challenging and full of obstacles. The key to creating an attainable goal is to look at your current life and set an objective that seems slightly beyond your reach. That way, even if you fail, you still accomplish something of significance. R. Relevant. Relevant goals focus on what you truly desire. They are the exact opposite of inconsistent or scattered goals. They are in harmony with everything that is important in your life, from success in your career to happiness with the people you love. T. Time-bound. Time-bound goals have specific deadlines. You are expected to achieve your desired outcome before a target date. Time-bound goals are challenging and grounding. The key to creating a time-bound goal is to set a deadline you'll meet by working backward and developing habits. Smart goals are clear and well-defined. There is no doubt about the result you want to achieve. At its deadline, you'll know if you have or haven't achieved a particular goal. Now, the best way to illustrate this concept is to show how you would write a smart goal. So, in the next part of the video, we will provide three examples from the seven different areas of your life for a total of 21 examples. One thing. The following goal examples are a mix of process and outcome goals. So, if you would like to learn more, then be sure to watch our video that explains the difference between these two types of goals.
